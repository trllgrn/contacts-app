# contacts-app
This is a contacts application I built on  a request from a potential client. Runs on Node.js. Front end is Backbone and jQuery Mobile
I'm currently looking for a place to host it for free.  If you know of a place, let me know!
For now, if you want to run it, you'll have to clone the repo.
